### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! My name is Beatriz Danielson and I am a Software Developer Intern. I am a highly motivated, creative problem solver and learner. I've been through a career transition and I'm looking for room to grow.
Recently, I have realized that I can combine my love for art, design, programming, and marketing. That combination is Software Development, a topic I have been diving into and learning on my spare time.
